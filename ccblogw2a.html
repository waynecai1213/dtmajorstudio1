            <h1> Prompt 2 - Five Questions</h1>
            <small class="date"> WEEK 2 - SUN, SEPT 8TH, 2019</small>
            <h3>QUESTION 1: How to think as a designer?</h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Keep peace and love to life and the world! Be passionate about everyday things--- observe
                how things work, how people interact with others, environment, artifacts and etc. Keep thinking and
                recording ideas that pop up in life. Put questions that I am interested in into practice in some class
                projects. In projects, carry out the five-steps design process, learning from making to practice
                creative research and always jump out of the box.
            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 2: How to learn those skills? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Take full advantage of the resources of the newschool like the University Learning Center
                and the Making Center. Ask for tutoring when needing help. ”Exchaning” skills with classmates would also
                be an efficient way to learn. More importantly, practice and learn in projects.

            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 3: How to improve my expressing ability? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>From my perspective, a design project is also a process of storytelling. Telling a good
                story requires me to possess adequate knowledge, so I would keep reading, thinking and absorbing. To
                expressing properly, firstly, I’m supposed to clear my role and the emotions I want to convey in a
                design project. Keep writing and documenting to clarify the logic between each step in the project.


            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 4: What is a good design and how to learn from them? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>To achieve this goal, in the first place I should learn how to critique others’ work
                including art and design since art and design are usually combined. For an artwork, observe first to
                gather the basic information about it, analyze and describe the art regarding its style, subject matter,
                and color. Then try to interpret its meaning. Last, evaluate and make my judgment about the art. As for
                design work, observe or use it to evaluate whether it fulfilling its purpose effectively and efficiently
                and whether it creates positive change and inspire with beautiful, intelligent craftsmanship. Later on,
                learn to give constructive feedback to promote my own thinking and development of others’ designs if
                possible.
            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 5: What kinds of social value I want to create?
            </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Keep an open mind and pay attention to some social issues, insight into them and combine
                with what I have learned in courses to find reasonable solutions or just convey ideas. I love nature and
                care about children, so to protect the natural environment and create better products and environments
                for children may be the social value I want to achieve. I want my design to be warm and happy, cope with
                people’s needs and touch with their emotions.
