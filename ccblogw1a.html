            <h1>Prompt 1 - Five Goals of Wayne</h1>
            <small class="date"> WEEK 1 - SUN, SEPT 1ST, 2019</small>
            <h3>GOAL 1: Developing my own thinking, methods and concepts of design</h3>
            <p>This is what identifies me as a designer and pushes me to figure out the design field I want to devote
                to. To achieve it, I will study and practice in various studios in DT, seek help and communication from
                teachers and classmates. Hopefully, I could form a rigorous but creative thinking.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 2: Developing a solid skills set </h3>
            <p>This would prepare my career as a professional designer. I need certain skills like coding, modeling,
                prototyping and etc to realize my design or convey some design ideas.
                e able to think and work independently and contribute to a team . I would learn in elective courses and
                dorkshops, communicate and learn from fellow classmates and practice in making projects. Meanwhile, I am
                supposed to be aware of the industry development.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 3: Being a good storyteller </h3>
            <p>Our world is established from all kinds of physical objects as well as various collective imaginations.
                Telling a good story requires me to possess adequate knowledge, so I would keep reading, thinking and
                absorbing. Telling a good story also requires me to have good communication and expression ability, and
                logical thinking as well. These skills would also help me perform better in teamwork.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 4: Good taste/aesthetic of design </h3>
            <p>A designer need to know what good design is first, then he would be able to make good design. I would
                take advantage of the rich museum resources in NYC, observe and insight into the multicultural city and
                get inspiration from it. Also, since a lot of fellow students in DT are from an art background, learning
                from the creative DT community would definitely help me achieve the goal.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 5: Participate in some projects with social value
            </h3>
            <p>I want to be a designer that understands and shoulders certain social responsibility. Pay attention to
                some social issues, insight into them and combine with what I have learned in courses to find reasonable
                solutions or just convey ideas.
