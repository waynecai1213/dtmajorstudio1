            <h1> Prompt 3 - Creative Intentions</h1>
            <small class="date"> WEEK 3 - SUN, SEPT 15TH, 2019</small>

            <p>
                Living in a world of increasingly fast-responsing technology and life pace, I feel rush all the time and
                sometimes anxious. It seems that we are optimizing our efficiency, but in fact, we ourselves are
                optimized by time management in turn. We are creating a way of life that can miss out on life itself.
            </p>
            <p>So my intention as a creative practitioner is to criticize the urban lifestyle and to explore the
                relationship between humans and technology, as well as creating something to educate people who live in
                a fast and busy world to reflect their life and hopefully gain some moment on peace and rest, and better
                face the future life.
             </p>
            <p>From a speculative perspective, I also intend to design for the future lifestyle in a reflective way.
                Bring human back in the center of their own life instead of being controlled by efficiency.
            </p>
