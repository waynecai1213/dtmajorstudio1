            <h3>Why Bryant Park?</h3>
            </p>
            Bryant Park is one of the few parks that are mostly enjoyed by local New Yorkers. Being surrounded by
            many office buildings, schools, and New York Public Library, you can find many students and young
            professionals hanging out at the park. However, the park is also a great place for kids and the elderly.
            Throughout the year Bryant Park hosts various activities including sports tournaments, painting
            sessions, dancing classes and much more.<strong>Bryant Park is a condensed miniature of New York
                itself</strong>: people from all different age groups, cultures and backgrounds exist harmoniously
            all in one place.

            <h4>Observation of Ping Pong:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Time: 12:00 - 12:40 pm</li>
                <li>Participant: 10 people</li>
                <li>Read instructions/ask staff: 12 people</li>
                <li>Stop to watch: 43 people</li>
                <li>Help to pick up balls: 31 people</li>
                <li>Participants:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most participants come regularly and they know each other, kind of shaping a community. Few
                        are
                        new to this game.
                    </li>
                    <li>The game is easily affected by wind.
                    </li>
                    <li>For those “irregular” participants, they always sign up and play with their friends coming
                        along.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Passersby:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some of them would interact with the participants by picking ping-pong coincidently.</li>
                    <li>Some of them were interested in joining the game but left because they need to sign in and
                        wait
                        for taking turns(10 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>A lot of people would stop to watch the game for a while.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Observation of Knitting:</h4>
            <p>
                Knitting was one of the activities that stood out for us. Knitting is known as a long, repetitive
                process that requires a lot of patience and commitment from one person. Usually, we associate this
                activity with moms or grandmas. We thought, how can we revolutionize this activity, reverse the
                making process and the maker:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contributed by many different people from different background/culture/generation</li>
                    <li> Short commitment - stitch one and go</li>
                    <li>Freeform</li>
                    <li> Visual interactions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Observation of the Fountain:</h4>
            <img src="images/MS1/Behavioral Mapping-3.png" alt="" class="img-post" id="dowebok"
                style="width: 100%; height:100%;">

            <ul>
                <li>The fountain is on the central axis of the park, with a large flow of passersby. </li>
                <li> Some people walked past the fountain without even looking at it.</li>
                <li> Most of the people who played around with water are children.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bryant Park is a space that suggests interactions and socialization - mostly human but also animals.
                After walking around the park and observing some different activities, we realized that - while
                Bryant Park is able to bring all different kinds of people together, <strong>they rarely interact
                    with one another,</strong> - there isn't much reason to. We'd like to give them a reason. A lot
                of people describe New Yorker as rude, cold-hearted and impatient. We want to find out if that
                really is the case.

            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Guiding Questions:</h4>
            </p>
            <p>How can we reinvent the purpose of an activity/game that changes the way people interact and their
                understanding of the game?</p>
            <p>How can we create a relaxing interactive experience among different groups of passersby but costs
                them little time?</p>

            <p><strong>How can we reignite people's curiosity for a daily object/architect/environment?</strong></p>

            <h3>Concept Sketch</h3>

            <p><strong>Inspired by knitting: </strong> <br>The idea is that we would enlarge the size of
                cross-stitch, setting up a big panel with thick yarn for passersby to knit.
            </p>
            <img src="images/MS1/sketch-1.png" alt="" class="img-post" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
            <p><strong>Interaction with the fountain :</strong>We planned to set up a set of fishing outfit right
                next to the fountain, hoping to create contrast to arouse people’s curiosity.</p>
