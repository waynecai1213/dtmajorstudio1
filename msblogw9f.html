                Using smartphone while talking to others is the most common multitasking and distraction in i-Generation's(born mid-1990s to early-2000s) daily social contact. As many research demonstrated, heavy multitaskers showed much worse social and emotional development. In-person, face-to-face interaction declined as digital-media use and electronic communication increased.  Such behaviors have started to bring emotional and mental health problem like FOMO(fear of missing out) to the young generation.  Yet face-to-face communication is considered as one of the powerful curative to the situation

            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> How to consider the problem of distraction and multitasking in social contact? 
                    </li>

                <li>  How could social media play a role in benefiting in-person social contact? 
             </li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> A "real" social media, that could motivate face-to-face communication. The time you could use this social media online is positive correlated to real world physical social contact.
                    </li>

                <li> When the system detects you are with your friends through location, it would remind you to contact with your friend and put your phone together to increase the available using time.
             </li>

            </ul>
