                <h2> 7 in 7 - Prototype 07 </h2>
                <small class="date"> WEEK 9 - TUE, OCT 29TH, 2019</small>
            </div>
            <p>
                Thinking from a similar perspective as the Prototype 4 and also inspired by the anthropomorphic lamp prototype we saw in the class, I made this prototype as an exploration and supplement. 
            </p>
            


            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> What if our daily object were also susceptible to external interruption and easily distracted just like us?
                    
                     </li>
              
                <li> Would this kind of interaction with physical object bring reflection to people thus reducing interruption from internal?
             </li>
        
            </ul>
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>A curious and susceptible lamp that would be as focused and distracted as I am, even worse. </p>
