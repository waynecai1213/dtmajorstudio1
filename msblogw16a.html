            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>Inspired by nudge theory and nudging behavior in social context between humans or animals, my final project presents serveral daily objects with personalities that could nudge users and bring
                people’s attention back. For these daily objects, each would have its own personalities that are
                extracted and reinterpreted from the original way they are used by humans. Through providing physical
                feedback such as movement and vibration, these objects would express their abstract and unique
                anthropomorphic or animal-like characteristics, thus creating and guiding new ways of interaction, which
                may help users focus on their original purpose of the current activity in this multitasking world. While
                these daily objects would retain their basic function and form features, the embodiment of their emotion
                would be supported by robotics, sensor technology, machine learning, and IoT. </p>

            <h3>Ozzie--- a distracted lamp </h3>
               <p> Most of us have a lamp on our desk in the room or the office, the lamp is a piece of indispensable furniture that accompanies us to study, to work, to grow. A lamp would always look at the desk providing light silently, no matter we are concentrated or not, we care about it or not. But what if it has its emotion and personality and responses to our behavior of possible distraction? </p>

                <iframe width="80%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgTOyh8c1xA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>For the current stage of prototyping, the realization of Ozzie’s function is mainly divided into two parts---<b>a robotic body and object detection</b>. </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Future Iteration </h3>
            
            <p> More specific user groups of Ozzie have yet to be verified.     User tests towards potential user groups
                such as school teenagers, college students and office workers would be conducted. There will be more
                specific adjustments to Ozzie's motion feedback depending on the behavior patterns of the different user
                groups.</p>
                <p>    A rewarding mechanism could be introduced into Ozzie in the future iteration to better encourage users
                in focusing on monotasking and to make the interaction with Ozzie more interesting. A small screen could
                be installed on Ozzie or the light that Ozzie projects could be an interface. By patting Ozzie, user
                could set the target time they want to stay focused. Ozzie’s motion and lights could be an interface for
                rewarding users. For example, after the user successfully doing monotasking for some time, Ozzie would
                move its body, nod its head and perform a colorful light animation as celebration to users success in
                focusing.
            </p>
            <p>Ozzie may start to respond to user’s possible behavior of multitasking before it actually happen, in order to create a brief moment in which user might reflect on what they are doing. 
            </p>


            <h3>Future Objects</h3>
            <p>
                Four objects with personalities to nudge users are also imagined based on the previous refined principles.
            </p>

        
            
            <h4>1. A Short-tempered Laptop</h4>
            <p>
            The laptop is easy to get angry, it would shut down its screen when it notices the user is distracted by other possible objects for some time. To reopen the screen, the user should comfort the laptop by touch and stroke the screen frame and the keyboard for a while.</p>

            <div class="div4center">
                <img src="images/MS1/Final/w16-d.gif" alt="" width="80%" height="auto">
               
            </div>

            <h4>2. A Naughty Table</h4>
            <p>
                The table would be excited and start to rotate its body like a naughty kid when it notices some electronic devices appear on it or above it. Users may need to put those devices away to calm down the table and enjoy their meal.</p>

            <h4> 3. A Needy Mouse</h4>
            <p>
                A mouse is always held by a human’s hand. By cooperating with the laptop and calculating the holding time and temperature from a human hand, it could learn the user’s patterns of work and study, thus detecting external distractions for the user. When it notices the user is distracted, it would start to move around on the desk seeking warmth from the user’s hand, just like a little needy animal.</p>

                <img src="images/MS1/Final/w16-e.gif" alt="" width="80%" height="auto">
            </div>
           <h4>4. A Sleepy Mirror</h4>
            <p>
                Instead of being clear and keep its eyes open all the time, the mirror is sleepy like a student in the class and it would take a nap (fuzzy itself) whenever it notices people are doing other things and do not watch it. People would need to wipe or knock the mirror to wake the mirror up and make it clear again.</p>
