                <h2> 7 in 7 - Prototype 03 </h2>

            </div>
            <p>
                I did another experiment today that when I wanted to use my mobile phone, I wrote down my purpose in
                using it. I kept my in Do Not Disturb mode in the whole day, so that I won't be distracted when I wasn't
                using the phone, also whether my behavior and interaction with my phone is intentional or unintentional,
                they only happened when I was actively using my phone.
            </p>
            <p>I found that even I set my phone in the Do Not Disturb mode, I would be interrupted and distracted by
                some other messages. For example, when I was looking up some words in the dictionary on my phone, an
                e-mail broke in and grabbed my attention. I tried to make myself remember to write the purpose down
                every time. But sometimes I opened an app and then noticed that I didn’t have any purposes, I was just
                habitually and mechanically opening the app, which I didn't intend to and it wasn't helpful at that
                time.
            </p>

            <p>While it is unrealistic to throw the phone, since it did bring us a lot of convenience. I found a lot of
                interruptions are those pop-up messages. And due to smart phone's ability to process and switch multiple
                applications, we are easily distracted by our unconsciously clicks.
            </p>

            <h3>Guiding Questions & Concept</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> What if we had a "monotasking" mode on our phone?  In monotasking mode, users are only allowed to open an application at a time, and while using the application, notifications from other applications would be blocked. </li>
                <li>What if we had to input our purpose first when open an application?
                </li>

            </ul>



            <h3>Prototype</h3>
          
            <div class="div4center">

            </div>

            <p>Users may be able to set their preference of the monotasking mode according to their working habits, choosing apps that could skip the question. But perhaps limiting such choice would be more effective. </p>
