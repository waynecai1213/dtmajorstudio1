            <h2> Prompt 2-Five Questions</h2>
            <small class="date"> WEEK 2 - MON, SEPT 9TH, 2019</small>
            <h3>QUESTION 1: How to think as a designer?</h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Keep peace and love to life and the world! Be passionate about everyday things--- observe
                how things work, how people interact with others, environment, artifacts and etc. Keep thinking and
                recording ideas that pop up in life. Put questions that I am interested in into practice in some class
                projects. In projects, carry out the five-steps design process, learning from making to practice
                creative research and always jump out of the box.
            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 2: How to learn those skills? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Take full advantage of the resources of the newschool like the University Learning Center
                and the Making Center. Ask for tutoring when needing help. ”Exchaning” skills with classmates would also
                be an efficient way to learn. More importantly, practice and learn in projects.

            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 3: How to improve my expressing ability? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>From my perspective, a design project is also a process of storytelling. Telling a good
                story requires me to possess adequate knowledge, so I would keep reading, thinking and absorbing. To
                expressing properly, firstly, I’m supposed to clear my role and the emotions I want to convey in a
                design project. Keep writing and documenting to clarify the logic between each step in the project.


            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 4: What is a good design and how to learn from them? </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>To achieve this goal, in the first place I should learn how to critique others’ work
                including art and design since art and design are usually combined. For an artwork, observe first to
                gather the basic information about it, analyze and describe the art regarding its style, subject matter,
                and color. Then try to interpret its meaning. Last, evaluate and make my judgment about the art. As for
                design work, observe or use it to evaluate whether it fulfilling its purpose effectively and efficiently
                and whether it creates positive change and inspire with beautiful, intelligent craftsmanship. Later on,
                learn to give constructive feedback to promote my own thinking and development of others’ designs if
                possible.
            </p>

            <h3>QUESTION 5: What kinds of social value I want to create?
            </h3>
            <p><b>Actions: </b>Keep an open mind and pay attention to some social issues, insight into them and combine
                with what I have learned in courses to find reasonable solutions or just convey ideas. I love nature and
                care about children, so to protect the natural environment and create better products and environments
                for children may be the social value I want to achieve. I want my design to be warm and happy, cope with
                people’s needs and touch with their emotions.

            </p>

            <h2>Prompt 1-Five Goals of Wayne</h2>
            <small class="date"> WEEK 1 - SUN, SEPT 1ST, 2019</small>
            <h3>GOAL 1: Developing my own thinking, methods and concepts of design</h3>
            <p>This is what identifies me as a designer and pushes me to figure out the design field I want to devote
                to. To achieve it, I will study and practice in various studios in DT, seek help and communication from
                teachers and classmates. Hopefully, I could form a rigorous but creative thinking.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 2: Developing a solid skills set </h3>
            <p>This would prepare my career as a professional designer. I need certain skills like coding, modeling,
                prototyping and etc to realize my design or convey some design ideas.
                e able to think and work independently and contribute to a team . I would learn in elective courses and
                dorkshops, communicate and learn from fellow classmates and practice in making projects. Meanwhile, I am
                supposed to be aware of the industry development.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 3: Being a good storyteller </h3>
            <p>Our world is established from all kinds of physical objects as well as various collective imaginations.
                Telling a good story requires me to possess adequate knowledge, so I would keep reading, thinking and
                absorbing. Telling a good story also requires me to have good communication and expression ability, and
                logical thinking as well. These skills would also help me perform better in teamwork.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 4: Good taste/aesthetic of design </h3>
            <p>A designer need to know what good design is first, then he would be able to make good design. I would
                take advantage of the rich museum resources in NYC, observe and insight into the multicultural city and
                get inspiration from it. Also, since a lot of fellow students in DT are from an art background, learning
                from the creative DT community would definitely help me achieve the goal.
            </p>
            <h3>GOAL 5: Participate in some projects with social value
            </h3>
            <p>I want to be a designer that understands and shoulders certain social responsibility. Pay attention to
                some social issues, insight into them and combine with what I have learned in courses to find reasonable
                solutions or just convey ideas.

                <h3>Why Bryant Park?</h3>
                </p>
                Bryant Park is one of the few parks that are mostly enjoyed by local New Yorkers. Being surrounded by
                many office buildings, schools, and New York Public Library, you can find many students and young
                professionals hanging out at the park. However, the park is also a great place for kids and the elderly.
                Throughout the year Bryant Park hosts various activities including sports tournaments, painting
                sessions, dancing classes and much more.<strong>Bryant Park is a condensed miniature of New York
                    itself</strong>: people from all different age groups, cultures and backgrounds exist harmoniously
                all in one place.

                <h4>Observation of Ping Pong:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time: 12:00 - 12:40 pm</li>
                    <li>Participant: 10 people</li>
                    <li>Read instructions/ask staff: 12 people</li>
                    <li>Stop to watch: 43 people</li>
                    <li>Help to pick up balls: 31 people</li>
                    <li>Participants:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most participants come regularly and they know each other, kind of shaping a community. Few
                            are
                            new to this game.
                        </li>
                        <li>The game is easily affected by wind.
                        </li>
                        <li>For those “irregular” participants, they always sign up and play with their friends coming
                            along.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Passersby:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some of them would interact with the participants by picking ping-pong coincidently.</li>
                        <li>Some of them were interested in joining the game but left because they need to sign in and
                            wait
                            for taking turns(10 minutes).
                        </li>
                        <li>A lot of people would stop to watch the game for a while.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>Observation of Knitting:</h4>
                <p>
                    Knitting was one of the activities that stood out for us. Knitting is known as a long, repetitive
                    process that requires a lot of patience and commitment from one person. Usually, we associate this
                    activity with moms or grandmas. We thought, how can we revolutionize this activity, reverse the
                    making process and the maker:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contributed by many different people from different background/culture/generation</li>
                        <li> Short commitment - stitch one and go</li>
                        <li>Freeform</li>
                        <li> Visual interactions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Observation of the Fountain:</h4>
                <img src="images/MS1/Behavioral Mapping-3.png" alt="" class="img-post" id="dowebok"
                    style="width: 100%; height:100%;">

                <ul>
                    <li>The fountain is on the central axis of the park, with a large flow of passersby. </li>
                    <li> Some people walked past the fountain without even looking at it.</li>
                    <li> Most of the people who played around with water are children.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Bryant Park is a space that suggests interactions and socialization - mostly human but also animals.
                    After walking around the park and observing some different activities, we realized that - while
                    Bryant Park is able to bring all different kinds of people together, <strong>they rarely interact
                        with one another,</strong> - there isn't much reason to. We'd like to give them a reason. A lot
                    of people describe New Yorker as rude, cold-hearted and impatient. We want to find out if that
                    really is the case.

                <p>
                    <h4>Guiding Questions:</h4>
                </p>
                <p>How can we reinvent the purpose of an activity/game that changes the way people interact and their
                    understanding of the game?</p>
                <p>How can we create a relaxing interactive experience among different groups of passersby but costs
                    them little time?</p>

                </p>

                <p><strong>How can we reignite people's curiosity for a daily object/architect/environment?</strong></p>

                <h3>Concept Sketch</h3>

                <p><strong>Inspired by knitting: </strong> <br>The idea is that we would enlarge the size of
                    cross-stitch, setting up a big panel with thick yarn for passersby to knit.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Interaction with the fountain :</strong>We planned to set up a set of fishing outfit right
                    next to the fountain, hoping to create contrast to arouse people’s curiosity.</p>
