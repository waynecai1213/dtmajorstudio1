            I am pretty lost beacuse anxiety and impatience are two different emotions and have different sources and as I tried to research them as a whole. Also, more problems such as multitasking and fragmented attention pop up during my research.  It was in a mess. I tried to explain the relationship between technology, multitasking, impatience, and anxiety. </p>
            <p>From the point of impatience, I learned why we show impatience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. We have a goal; </li>
                    <li>2. We have accepted certain costs (including opportunity costs) for reaching the goal; </li>
                        <li>3. it’s going to cost us more than we thought to reach the goal; </li>
                            <li>4. We start looking for ways to avoid having to pay those extra costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this high-tech age, as we are pursuing efficiency, we tend to do as more as possible in a certain period of time. And technologies provide that possibility. As fast-responding technology provides opportunities for multitasking and instant gratification, we are now increasingly easy to be distracted and our attention is fragmented. So it is easier and more often for us to show impatience and anxiety. However, this process is just based on my experience, I may need more research for it. </p>

<p>I also wondering if high-tech has changed people’s perception of time, since the response of technology is becoming faster. For example, search engines used to take a dozen seconds to show the results, now it takes less than one second. Even so, people are impatient than before.</p>
