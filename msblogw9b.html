            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> How much distracting information we would come across in a day?</li>
                    <li>How to visualize fragmented attention?</li>
                    <li>What if I do it in an extreme way? </li>


                </ul>



                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Look back all the website I viewed today, and cover those areas where distracting information shows
                    on the screen with masking tape.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>I opened 1014 webpages today.</p> -->
                <img src="" alt="">
                
                <div class="div4center">
                        <img src="images/MS1/7in7/w9b-2.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">
                </div>
                <small>This prototype is more of an experiment.</small>
                <p>I found that Chinese websites have a lot more distracting information than English ones in general. A
                    lot of those information is irrelevant ads and news.</p>
                <p>Some information is scrolled along with the webpages, made it tickey to cover the screen.</p>

                <p>This experiment could be transplanted into an sreen installation, which would track the audience's
                    eyes and require audience to focus on certain area on a webpage. To challenge the audience, some
                    distracting information would show along.
               When the audience is distracted by the information, the information would completely blacken or
                    disappear, making the audience realize that they are distracted.</p>
                <p>But it would bring the audience a feeling of being controlled instead of of controling.</p>

                <p>I might have gone into a wrong direction since a lot of websites privided information in multiple
                    dimensions for users' convenience and a lot of them make money through ads.</p>
