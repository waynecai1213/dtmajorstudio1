                <h2> Midterm Reflection</h2>
                <small class="date"> WEEK 8 - SUN, OCT 20TH, 2019</small>
                
                    <p>
                        My research question is “How to alleviate people’s impatience and anxiety in today’s context of
                        rapid technology and life pace?” at the very beginning. However, the question is too broad and
                        when I started to research, I lost in it and suffered. And in the month-long research so far, I
                        remained superficial at the question about impatience and technology and did breadth search
                        instead of depth search, failed to look deep into some certain points that could carry me to a
                        clear research question.
                        I have to say that my research process is in a mess due to my poor knowledge reserves and
                        methods in researching.</p>

                    <p>In the midterm, I tried to figure out the relationship between today’s fast respond technology
                        and impatience, but as I researched, it drew me to think about more problems with multitasking
                        and distraction. I tried to explain what’s the relationship between all those parts and draw the
                        “trap of speed” graph which may be insufficiently rigorous. I found that Speed Limit calls for a
                        change in value, which is in line with my idea. It led my question to “How could we cultivate
                        patience and bring mental rest to people living at a fast pace?” Since I mentioned impatience in
                        a way that is too broad, it then led to meditation which could be a general solution for almost
                        all kinds of mental health. Then I researched some tools to guide meditation as precedents.</p>

                    <p>In the midterm critique, Anna suggested that mindfulness is not just a transactional experience,
                        and Melanie pointed out that meditation actually doesn’t need any technology at all. Also,
                        Harpreet indicated that VR meditation is a false proposition. Since I lack self-experience in
                        meditation, I would stop thinking about meditation for the moment.</p>

                    <p>Both professors suggested me to look into more about people’s fragmented attention/ distraction,
                        to figure out the physiological reasons and transformation behind it. I agree that it was a good
                        point to restart my research. To be honest, my research question is still fuzzy. I wonder if
                        technology should take the responsibilities of people’s fragmented attention. If so, <b> how to
                            make people aware of the defect of fragmented attention brought by technology?</b></p>

                    <p>I tried to research it and it seems obvious that in the always-connected world of mobile devices,
                        it is much harder to stay focused in the middle of everything we read, and some news and
                        articles claimed that human’s average attention spans are shrinking because of technology. But
                        this is somehow misleading because I cannot find any evidence that human’s average attention
                        spans are shrinking.</p>

                    <p>The reading Changing perspective suggests designers to change the perspective on the problem when
                        coming up with new solutions, and it provides several skills which could be inspiring. Refine
                        your language and Ask different questions remind me that I may have some misunderstandings about
                        my question. For the previous research question, I did not have a clear definition of
                        “technology” and “impatience”. In the current research question, I think technology may mostly
                        refer to the mobile internet and smart devices. I find that my focus lays on the influence that
                        technology brought to humans and I want to critique those detrimental parts. One the next move,
                        I would like to research about how mobile internet and smart technology change human’s physical
                        body, psychology, and behavioral, try to figure out the power relationship between humans and
                        those technology.
