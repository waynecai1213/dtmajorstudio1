                <h2> Final Project Reflection </h2>
                <small class="date"> WEEK 17 - MON, DEC 16TH, 2019</small>
            </div>

            <p>
                From start to mid-term and final, my intention to research question is actually to critique how modern
                technology influence human mentally and behaviorally. And after midterm, my specific questions changed
                to “How to make people aware of the defect of fragmented attention caused by technology?”, with which I
                started prototyping in 7in7. Even though I have guiding questions for each day’s prototype, those
                questions are lack of advance planning and structure. So there is somewhat a lack of logic in the
                prototypes I made in 7in7. My 7in7 is more like brainstorming. With prototypes I made in 7in7, my
                specific research question became “How would interaction with physical objects bring reflection to/nudge
                people thus reducing multitasking”. </p>
            <p>My project has a relatively high degree of completion in look and feel. The role of this prototype shows
                fine in the video, but the implementation part is still weak due to my lack of technical knowledge and
                time. The form that I used to address the problem of multitasking and distraction is novel. The form
                that products with personality challenge people’s understanding and attention to our relationship with
                everyday things. My project tries to solve the problems of the moment and takes a future-oriented
                approach. It would embody relatively advanced technology like computer vision and machine learning. The
                interaction with such objects is fun and may bring a feeling of being accompanied.</p>
            <p>As for the form itself, how to embody their personality through their motion and feedback is critical.
                The current mechanism is that the objects work as usual when the user focus and they only show
                personality when the user is distracted. Such feedback may seem to be more of a punishment for the user
                than encouragement for concentration. This negative reinforcement is sometimes contradictory. The form
                of my final prototype is actually just from brainstorming, so more rigorous reasoning and testing are
                still needed, even though I’ve tried to clarify it in the final presentation. After all, many people
                thought that the lamp itself would be a distraction instead of helping people focus. I may need to
                figure out my target audiences or take different forms for different user groups. Objects with
                personalities may also need something else to form an effective mechanism to help users focus, for
                example, an app or the changes of the light as an interface for a rewarding mechanism. Another issue is
                that I question myself is that is the problem I tried to solve as broad as multitasking or just
                addiction to the cellphone. Because currently my prototypes are all based on contexts when the cellphone
                is a distraction. If it is to solve the problem of distraction or cellphone addiction, how to
                distinguish it from other products to make it more effective rather than merely novel in form. </p>
            <p>The current concept maybe not closely connected to the form. Objects with personalities are an
                interesting research field to me but applying it to solve the problem of multitasking maybe a little
                reluctant and narrow. To solve the problem of multitasking and distraction, I may need to think about
                other more efficient and humanized forms as well as more scenarios. As for objects with personalities, I
                may reconsider it from a speculative perspective and find its application scenarios and specific user
                groups. Or to think about what does objects has personality actually mean from a critical point of view.
